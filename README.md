# Hytale Plugin Template
A minimal template for creating Hytale server plugins and the quickest way to get started today.<br> 
API documentation is still in progress as the game is also in early access, so looking through decompiled code will be necessary for now.

## Prerequisites
- Java 25 JDK (Hypixel Studios recommends [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases))
- Gradle 9.x or higher

## Building the Template
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonesoj/hytale-plugin-template.git
cd hytale-plugin-template/
./gradlew build
```
